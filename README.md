# Thomas Ciszek's Portfolio

## Description

- This project utilized my current knowledge of HTML5 and CSS to design a portfolio for myself
- While my portfolio will be ever changing and getting more complex and in-depth, this website will serve as a guide and a starting point
- The website starts with a title and clickable links that will direct you to different sections on the page
- The next section is a secondary title with a linear gradient background
- The about section contains a recent picture of myself, along with a blurb about myself and the portfolio
- The projects section contains clickable image links that direct the user to some of my other projects
- The last section is the contact section, which contains ways of reaching me, as well as my github and linkedin accounts

## The Website

The website is currently deployed at https://thomascsk.github.io/portfolio/
